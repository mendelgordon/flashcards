Store does not have a valid reducer. Make sure the argument passed to combineReducers is an object whose values are reducers.

<!-- Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it's running React 17. Learn more: https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot
done  -->
<!-- Warning: React does not recognize the `activeClassName` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `activeclassname` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.
